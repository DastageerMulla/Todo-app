# Todo-app

This is a simple and interactive Todo List Application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app allows users to keep track of their daily tasks by adding, completing, and deleting items. Its clean and responsive design makes task management easy and enjoyable for everyone.

The main features of the Todo App include adding new tasks quickly, marking tasks as completed, and removing tasks from the list. The interface is designed to be intuitive, so users can focus on their tasks without any distractions. For now, the data exists only in the browser session, but it can be enhanced to store tasks using local storage in the future.

This project was created using HTML for the structure, CSS for styling and layout, and JavaScript for interactivity. The combination of these technologies makes it lightweight and fast, and it can run directly in any modern web browser without the need for additional tools or libraries.

Future improvements for the app could include the ability to edit tasks, categorize them by priority, implement a dark/light mode, or save tasks permanently using browser storage. Overall, this project serves as a great example of a beginner-friendly web application that demonstrates basic front-end development skills.
